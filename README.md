# ESA transformation framework

The ESA Transformation Framework is a component of the
Copernicus Sentinels Collaborative Data Hub Software (DHS) intended to provide
data transformation capabilities via the integration of processing elements
applied on-demand to Copernicus Sentinel products, prior to delivery to the users.

## Features

In its current development status *Alpha*, it features:

- The ability to define and configure workflows
  (i.e. processing elements), via a plugin architecture. (DHS-EVO-31, DHS-EVO-36)
- The ability to perform parallel processing on the local host
  or over a distributed architecture. (DHS-EVO-33)
- The functionalities which allow setting workflow parameters and options
  [via a REST API](#How-to-test-API-endpoints). (DHS-EVO-32)
- A [Sen2Cor plugin](https://step.esa.int/main/snap-supported-plugins/sen2cor/)
  which uses Sen2Cor v2.10 tool to convert Sentinel-2 L1C products into L2A output products,
  also using the *SRTM DEM* for terrain correction, classification and atmospheric correction. (DHS-EVO-35)
- A deployment [via docker-compose](#Docker-compose-startup). (DHS-MNT-16)
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions.

Other features in the roadmap:

- Product reformatting plugin (GeoTIFF, etc) (DHS-EVO-34)
- Add support for multiple users.
- Compute traceability record and upload it to the traceability service.
- Integrate logging and monitoring in the DHS.
- Installation and administration manual.

### Notes

- The activation of ESA-CCI data-package necessary for Sen2Cor plugin
  to generate products compatible with L2A Core products is not included in this release.
- The selection of a Region of Interest (ROI)
  with Sen2Cor plugin is not yet supported by the REST API.
- Failed requests are not re-tried.

## Docker compose setup

Required docker engine configuration:

- resources -> advanced -> memory `>6Gb`
- resources -> advanced -> disk image size `>50Gb`

Required software on the VM:

- `docker-compose`
- `make`
- `curl`
- `unzip`
- `tar`

Change folder to `esa_tf` and download the external resources:

```bash
cd esa_tf
make setup
```

Configure the users names and passwords to access the external data sources in the file
`config/hubs_credentials.yaml`, the folder where the ESA Transformation Framework
will place the outputs and the owner userid in the `.env` file.

Finally, start the docker compose:

```bash
make up
```

The API endpoints will be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

## How to test API endpoints

To easily test REST API from the command line you can use the following softwares:

- `curl`
- `jq`

### List of plugins

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/Workflows | jq
```

### Access plugin definition

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/Workflows('sen2cor_l1c_l2a')" | jq
```

### List of transformation orders

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders | jq
```

#### Filters transformation orders

It is also possible to filter accessible orders.
Filters are applied using standard OData `$filter` query parameter; following clauses can be used:

`Status`
: Filter by transformation status (e.g: `in_progress`, `completed`, â€¦)  
  Example:

  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders?\$filter=Status%20eq%20'completed'" | jq
  ```
  
`SubmissionDate`
: Filter by submission date. Date must be a string in ISO format.  
  Example:

  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders?\$filter=SubmissionDate%20eq%20'2022-01-25T08:53:47.961866'" | jq
  ```

`CompletedDate`
: Filter by date of completion. Date must be a string in ISO format.  
  Example:

  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders?\$filter=CompletedDate%20eq%20'2022-01-25T09:07:51.908863'" | jq
  ```

`InputProductReference`
: Filter by input product filename. This will be treated as an exact match  
  Example:

  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders?\$filter=InputProductReference%20eq%20'S2A_MSIL1C_20211022T062221_N0301_R048_T39GWH_20211022T064132.zip'" | jq
  ```

It's also possible to combine filters by using then `and` operator:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders?\$filter=CompletedDate%20eq%20'2022-01-25T09:07:51.908863'%20and%20InputProductReference%20eq%20'S2A_MSIL1C_20211022T062221_N0301_R048_T39GWH_20211022T064132.zip'" | jq
```

The `and` operator is not the only one supported.
You can also use:

- `lt`
- `gt`
- `ge`
- `le`

A filter request like the following is perfectly valid:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders?\$filter=CompletedDate%20ge%20'2022-01-01'%20and%20CompletedDate%20lt%20'2022-02-01'" | jq
```

#### Count results

You can ask for number of results by using the `$count` parameter:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders?\$filter=Status%20eq%20'completed'&\$count=true" | jq
```

This will add the `odata.count` field to the results set.

To obtain directly the number of transformation you can access, you can use the `$count` path suffix:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders/\$count" | jq
```

### Request a new transformation

```bash
curl -v -d '{"WorkflowId": "sen2cor_l1c_l2a", "InputProductReference": {"Reference": "S2A_MSIL1C_20211022T062221_N0301_R048_T39GWH_20211022T064132.zip", "DataSourceName": "scihub"}, "WorkflowOptions": {"Aerosol_Type": "MARITIME", "Mid_Latitude": "AUTO", "Ozone_Content": 0, "Cirrus_Correction": true, "DEM_Terrain_Correction": true}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders | jq
```

### Monitoring status of a transformation order

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders('9e58ff8a4553a15607eae4ce85736811')" | jq
```

You can also inspect the current output from the transformation itself.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/TransformationOrders('9e58ff8a4553a15607eae4ce85736811')/Log/\$value"
```
